This project is built to automate a fun and weird family tradition: The Bobble Head Tournament. Each Christmas my family determines whose university is the winner, just of football games played between universities my family members attended. The winner receives a football player bobblehead.

The "tournament" works as follows: 
So if Columbia plays Penn and wins (like they did this past season!) I get +1 point and my mom gets -1 point (because she went to Penn). Each victory against another family members school is +1, each loss is -1. It gets complicated because some of my family members have attended up to 4 schools! Also, some members have their points "cancelled out" because they have attended two colleges who play eachother. So if one member has attended Georgia Tech and UGA and those two teams played, automatically that's a net zero. 

My code is implemented as follows:
